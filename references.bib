	abstract = {Synthetic lethality, an interaction whereby the co-occurrence of two or more genetic events lead to cell death but one event alone does not, can be exploited to develop novel cancer therapeutics1. DNA repair processes represent attractive synthetic lethal targets since many cancers exhibit an impaired DNA repair pathway, which can lead these cells to become dependent on specific repair proteins2. The success of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) inhibitors in homologous recombination-deficient cancers highlights the potential of this approach in clinical oncology3,4. Hypothesizing that other DNA repair defects would give rise to alternative synthetic lethal relationships, we asked if there are specific dependencies in cancers with microsatellite instability (MSI), which results from impaired DNA mismatch repair (MMR). Here we analyzed data from large-scale CRISPR/Cas9 knockout and RNA interference (RNAi) silencing screens and found that the RecQ DNA helicase WRN was selectively essential in MSI cell lines, yet dispensable in microsatellite stable (MSS) cell lines. WRN depletion induced double-strand DNA breaks and promoted apoptosis and cell cycle arrest selectively in MSI models. MSI cancer models specifically required the helicase activity, but not the exonuclease activity of WRN. These findings expose WRN as a synthetic lethal vulnerability and promising drug target in MSI cancers.},

    abstract = "{limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.}",
